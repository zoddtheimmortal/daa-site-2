# Clique Listing Algorithms

## Cliques

In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. That is, a clique of a graph \(G\) is an induced subgraph of \(G\) that is complete.

In computer science, the **clique problem** is the computational problem of finding a **maximum clique**, or all cliques, in a given graph. It is **NP-complete**, one of **Karp's 21 NP-complete problems**.
